`Host`

Refers to any device or computer that is connected to the network and has an Internet Protocol (IP) address. We can divide hosts into two categories: clients and servers.
- A client is often a desktop or laptop computer, a smartphone, a video game console, or, with the emergence of the Internet of Things, a smart baby monitor, a seismic or animal habitat surveillance system, a smartwatch, etc.
- A server is a much more powerful machine that stores and distributes web pages, streams videos, transfers email, etc.

A host sends data through a network connection, which can be through an Ethernet cable, Wi-Fi connection, or other network technology. The host uses a communication protocol, such as Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP), to break down the data into packets and send those packets through the network to the correct recipient.

`The Physical Components of the Internet`

- Network Cables: Network cables are used to connect devices to each other and to the internet. The most common types of network cables are Ethernet cables, which use twisted pair wires to transmit data at high speeds.

- Switches: Switches are devices that connect multiple devices to a network and allow them to communicate with each other. They help to direct data packets to the correct destination.

- Routers: Routers are devices that connect multiple networks together, such as a home network to the internet. They help to route data packets between networks and ensure that data is delivered to the correct destination.

- Modems: Modems are devices that connect a home or business network to the internet. They convert digital data from the network into analog signals that can be transmitted over phone or cable lines.

- Servers: Servers are powerful computers that store and process data and provide services to other devices on the network. They can be used for web hosting, email hosting, file hosting, and many other purposes.

- Data Centers: Data centers are large facilities that house many servers and other networking equipment. They are used to store, manage, and process large amounts of data and provide services to businesses and organizations.

- Wireless Access Points: Wireless access points are devices that provide wireless connectivity to devices on a network. They are commonly used in homes, businesses, and public spaces to provide Wi-Fi access.
